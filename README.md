# RPi Home Monitor

[![CI](https://github.com/vinu-engineer/rpi-home-monitor/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vinu-engineer/rpi-home-monitor/actions/workflows/test.yml)

**A self-hosted home security camera system built on Raspberry Pi.** Open-source alternative to Ring, Tapo, and Nest — with no cloud subscriptions, no vendor lock-in, and complete control over your data.

RPi Home Monitor runs **Home Monitor OS**, a custom Linux distribution built with the Yocto Project, purpose-built for home surveillance on low-cost hardware.

## Why RPi Home Monitor?

- **Your data stays home.** Video never leaves your network. No cloud uploads, no third-party access, no monthly fees.
- **Security by design.** TLS everywhere, mTLS between cameras, encrypted storage (LUKS), firewall-hardened OS, bcrypt auth with rate limiting.
- **Built on real hardware.** Runs on a $35 Raspberry Pi 4B (server) and $15 Zero 2W (cameras). No proprietary hardware required.
- **Automatic camera discovery.** Plug in a camera node, connect it to WiFi, and it appears in your dashboard via mDNS.
- **OTA updates with rollback.** A/B partition scheme means failed updates automatically roll back. No bricked devices.
- **Tapo-style recording.** Continuous 3-minute MP4 clips organized by camera and date, with timeline playback.
- **Fully open source.** Inspect every line, from the OS image to the web dashboard. AGPL-3.0 licensed.

| Component | Hardware | Role |
|-----------|----------|------|
| **Home Server** | Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4GB+) | Receives streams, records clips, serves web dashboard, manages cameras |
| **Camera Node** | Raspberry Pi Zero 2W + ZeroCam | Captures 1080p video, streams to server over RTSPS |
| **Dashboard** | Any phone/laptop on LAN | Live view (HLS), clip playback, camera management, system admin |

## Key Features

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Live View | HLS streaming in any mobile browser |
| Recording | Continuous 3-minute MP4 clips, organized by camera/date |
| Camera Management | Auto-discovery, confirm/rename/remove via dashboard |
| User Auth | bcrypt passwords, session management, CSRF protection, rate limiting |
| Role-Based Access | Admin (full control) and Viewer (read-only) roles |
| System Health | CPU temp, memory, disk usage, uptime monitoring |
| Storage Management | Automatic cleanup of oldest clips when disk is full |
| OTA Updates | Signed firmware updates with A/B rollback |
| Audit Logging | All admin actions logged (append-only) |
| Encrypted Storage | LUKS-encrypted /data partition for recordings and config |
| Firewall | nftables — cameras can only talk to server, minimal open ports |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone git@github.com:vinu-engineer/rpi-home-monitor.git ~/yocto
cd ~/yocto

# Install prerequisites (Ubuntu 24.04)
./scripts/setup-env.sh

# Build images
./scripts/build.sh server-dev      # RPi 4B development image
./scripts/build.sh camera-dev      # Zero 2W development image

# Flash to SD card
bzcat build/tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi4-64/home-monitor-image-dev-*.wic.bz2 \
  | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
```

First build takes 2-4 hours. Subsequent builds use cached artifacts and are much faster.

## Build Targets

| Command | Board | Image |
|---------|-------|-------|
| `./scripts/build.sh server-dev` | RPi 4B | Development (debug, root SSH) |
| `./scripts/build.sh server-prod` | RPi 4B | Production (hardened, no root) |
| `./scripts/build.sh camera-dev` | Zero 2W | Development (debug, root SSH) |
| `./scripts/build.sh camera-prod` | Zero 2W | Production (hardened, no root) |

## Run Tests

```bash
cd app/server && pytest
cd app/camera && pytest
```

Test results and coverage reports are available in the [CI workflow](https://github.com/vinu-engineer/rpi-home-monitor/actions).

# RPi Home Monitor - Development Guide

Version: 1.0
Date: 2026-04-09

**This document defines the rules for all development on this project.**
Every contributor (human or AI) must follow these rules. They are not
suggestions — they are mandatory for maintaining a production-quality codebase.

---

## 1. Git Workflow

### 1.1 Branch Strategy

```
main                         ← Always deployable. Protected.
  ├── feature/camera-pairing ← New features
  ├── fix/storage-cleanup    ← Bug fixes
  ├── recipe/add-swupdate    ← Yocto recipe changes
  ├── docs/update-api-spec   ← Documentation only
  └── release/v1.1.0         ← Release preparation
```

**Rules:**
- **NEVER commit directly to `main`.** All changes go through feature branches + pull requests.
- Branch naming: `<type>/<short-description>` where type is one of:
  - `feature/` — new functionality
  - `fix/` — bug fix
  - `recipe/` — Yocto recipe additions or changes
  - `config/` — build configuration changes
  - `docs/` — documentation only
  - `refactor/` — code restructuring with no behavior change
  - `security/` — security fixes (prioritize these)
  - `release/` — release preparation
- Branch from `main`, merge back to `main` via PR.
- Delete branch after merge.

### 1.2 Commit Rules

- **One logical change per commit.** Don't mix recipe changes with app changes.
- **Commit message format:**
  ```
  <type>: <short summary in imperative mood>

  <optional body explaining WHY, not what>

  Refs: #<issue-number> (if applicable)
  ```
  Types: `feat`, `fix`, `recipe`, `config`, `docs`, `refactor`, `security`, `test`, `chore`
- **Examples:**
  ```
  feat: add camera discovery via mDNS
  fix: prevent storage cleanup from deleting clips less than 24h old
  recipe: add swupdate to server image for OTA support
  config: pin OpenSSL to 3.5.x in distro config
  security: enforce mTLS on RTSP camera connections
  ```
- **Never use** `--no-verify`, `--force`, or `--amend` on shared branches.
- **Never rewrite history** on `main` or any branch others may have pulled.

### 1.3 Pull Request Process

1. Create branch from latest `main`
2. Make changes, commit with proper messages
3. Push branch, open PR
4. PR description must include:
   - **What** changed (summary)
   - **Why** it changed (motivation)
   - **How to test** (steps to verify)
   - **Yocto impact** — does this require a rebuild? Which image?
5. Self-review the diff before requesting review
6. After merge, delete the branch

### 1.4 Release Process

1. Create `release/vX.Y.Z` branch from `main`
2. Update version numbers:
   - `meta-home-monitor/conf/distro/home-monitor.conf` → `DISTRO_VERSION`
   - `app/server/setup.py` → `version`
   - `app/camera/setup.py` → `version`
3. Build all 4 images (server-dev, server-prod, camera-dev, camera-prod)
4. Test dev images on hardware
5. Merge to `main`, tag `vX.Y.Z`
6. Create GitHub Release with prod images attached
7. **Semantic versioning:**
   - `MAJOR` — breaking changes (partition layout, API incompatible)
   - `MINOR` — new features (new API endpoints, new packages)
   - `PATCH` — bug fixes, security patches

---

## 2. Yocto Rules

### 2.1 Distro Policy

- **All system policy lives in `home-monitor.conf`.** Never put DISTRO_FEATURES, init manager, or package classes in `local.conf`.
- **`local.conf` is machine-specific only:** MACHINE, GPU_MEM, WiFi firmware, CPU threads. Nothing else.
- **Never use `DISTRO = "poky"`.** Always `DISTRO = "home-monitor"`.
- **Pin critical package versions** in the distro config. If you upgrade a version, test the full image.

### 2.2 Layer Rules

- **All custom recipes go in `meta-home-monitor`.** Never modify upstream layers (poky, meta-raspberrypi, meta-openembedded).
- **To customize an upstream recipe, use a `.bbappend`** in meta-home-monitor. Never fork the recipe.
- **Layer priority is 10** (higher than defaults). This is intentional — our customizations win.
- **LAYERSERIES_COMPAT must match the release.** Currently `scarthgap`. Update when upgrading Yocto.
- **Never add a layer dependency** without verifying it's available and compatible with scarthgap.

### 2.3 Recipe Rules

- **Every recipe must have:**
  - `SUMMARY` — one line, what it does
  - `DESCRIPTION` — detailed purpose
  - `LICENSE` and `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM` — mandatory, even for our own code
  - `RDEPENDS` — explicit runtime dependencies (don't rely on implicit)
- **Recipe naming:** `<package-name>_<version>.bb` (e.g., `monitor-server_1.0.bb`)
- **Use `inherit` properly:** `systemd` for services, `packagegroup` for groups, `setuptools3` for Python packages.
- **SRC_URI:** Always use `file://` for local files, full URLs for remote. Never use `git://` (use `https://`).
- **Never use `DEPENDS` when you mean `RDEPENDS`.** DEPENDS = build-time, RDEPENDS = runtime.
- **Test recipe changes with:** `bitbake <recipe> -c cleansstate && bitbake <recipe>` before committing.

### 2.4 Image Rules

- **Shared content goes in `.inc` files.** Image variants (dev/prod) are thin `.bb` files that `require` the `.inc`.
- **Never add packages directly to image `.bb` files** unless they're variant-specific (e.g., gdb in dev only). Add them to the appropriate packagegroup instead.
- **Packagegroup naming:** `packagegroup-<product>-<function>.bb` (e.g., `packagegroup-monitor-security.bb`)
- **Dev image rules:**
  - Includes `debug-tweaks` (root login, no password)
  - Includes dev tools (gdb, strace, tcpdump)
  - Used for development and testing only
  - **Never flash a dev image to a production device**
- **Prod image rules:**
  - No `debug-tweaks`
  - No root password, key-only SSH
  - No dev tools
  - This is what ships to real devices

### 2.5 Build Verification

Before any Yocto change is committed:

1. **Parse check:** `bitbake -p <image>` — must show 0 errors
2. **Dry-run dependency check:** `bitbake -g <image>` — verify dependency graph
3. **Full build** for affected images (at least once before merging to main)
4. **Boot test** on hardware or QEMU (for significant changes)

### 2.6 Configuration Management

- **`bblayers.conf`** is shared between all machines. One file, committed to git.
- **Adding a new layer:**
  1. Add clone command to `scripts/build.sh`
  2. Add to `config/bblayers.conf`
  3. Add to `LAYERDEPENDS` in `layer.conf` if required
  4. Document in README.md
  5. Verify: `bitbake-layers show-layers`
- **Adding a new machine:**
  1. Create `config/<machine>/local.conf` (minimal, machine-specific only)
  2. Add build target to `scripts/build.sh`
  3. Create image `.inc` and dev/prod `.bb` files if needed
  4. Document in README.md

---

## 3. Application Development Rules

### 3.1 Code Organization

- **Application code lives in `app/`, never in Yocto recipe `files/` directories.**
- **Yocto recipes reference `app/` via `FILESEXTRAPATHS`.** The recipe is just packaging.
- **Server app structure:**
  ```
  app/server/monitor/
    __init__.py          ← App factory (create_app)
    auth.py              ← Auth module
    models.py            ← Data classes
    api/<blueprint>.py   ← One file per API area
    services/<service>.py ← One file per background service
    templates/<page>.html ← One file per page
    static/              ← CSS, JS (no build tools)
  ```
- **Camera app structure:**
  ```
  app/camera/camera_streamer/
    main.py              ← Entry point
    <module>.py          ← One file per responsibility
  ```

### 3.2 Python Rules

- **Python 3.10+ minimum.** Use type hints on all function signatures.
- **No external dependencies beyond what Yocto provides.** Check `bitbake -s | grep python3-` before adding any import. If it's not in Yocto, don't use it.
- **Flask app factory pattern** — always use `create_app()`, never module-level app.
- **Blueprints for API organization** — one blueprint per resource area.
- **No ORM, no SQLAlchemy, no database.** JSON files on `/data` partition.
- **File I/O must use `/data/` paths** (from environment variables). Never hardcode paths.
- **All config from environment variables or `/data/config/`.** Never hardcode IPs, ports, or credentials.
- **Error handling:**
  - Catch specific exceptions, never bare `except:`.
  - Log errors with context (camera ID, file path, etc.).
  - API errors return proper JSON with HTTP status codes.
  - Never expose internal errors to the user (no tracebacks in API responses).
- **Logging:**
  - Use Python's `logging` module, never `print()`.
  - Log levels: DEBUG (dev only), INFO (normal operations), WARNING (recoverable), ERROR (failures), CRITICAL (system down).
  - All log output goes to journald via systemd.

### 3.3 Security Rules (Non-Negotiable)

These rules apply to ALL code, whether application or recipe:

- **Never store passwords in plaintext.** Always bcrypt hash (cost 12).
- **Never log passwords, tokens, or certificates.** Redact in log messages.
- **Never hardcode secrets** (passwords, keys, tokens) in source code or recipes.
- **All user input is untrusted.** Validate and sanitize everything from HTTP requests.
- **SQL injection is not possible** (no SQL), but **command injection is.** Never pass user input to `subprocess`, `os.system`, or shell commands without proper escaping. Use `subprocess.run()` with list arguments, never shell=True with user data.
- **Path traversal:** Validate all file paths from user input. Never allow `../` in clip filenames or camera IDs.
- **CSRF tokens on all state-changing endpoints** (POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Session cookies:** Always `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`.
- **TLS:** All network communication must use TLS. No exceptions, no "we'll add it later."
- **Secrets on disk** (users.json, certs) must be on the LUKS-encrypted `/data` partition with restrictive file permissions (0600 for keys, 0640 for config).

### 3.4 API Design Rules

- **Prefix all API routes with `/api/v1/`.** Version from day one.
- **RESTful conventions:**
  - `GET` = read (safe, idempotent)
  - `POST` = create
  - `PUT` = update (full replace)
  - `PATCH` = partial update
  - `DELETE` = remove
- **Response format:** Always JSON. Use consistent structure:
  ```json
  {"status": "ok", "data": {...}}
  {"status": "error", "message": "human-readable error"}
  ```
- **HTTP status codes:** 200 (ok), 201 (created), 400 (bad request), 401 (unauthorized), 403 (forbidden), 404 (not found), 429 (rate limited), 500 (server error).
- **Auth required on ALL endpoints** except `POST /api/v1/auth/login` and the first-boot setup.
- **Admin-only endpoints** must check role. A viewer hitting an admin endpoint gets 403, not a different error.
- **When adding a new endpoint:**
  1. Add to the blueprint in `app/server/monitor/api/`
  2. Update `docs/requirements.md` (SR-SRV-12: REST API section)
  3. Add auth decorator and role check
  4. Add audit log entry for state-changing operations

### 3.5 Frontend Rules

- **Mobile-first.** Design for phone screens, scale up to desktop.
- **No build tools** (no webpack, no npm, no node_modules). Plain HTML, CSS, JS.
- **No frontend frameworks** (no React, no Vue). Vanilla JS + Jinja2 templates.
- **Dark theme by default** (camera monitoring UIs are used in dim rooms).
- **HLS.js is the only external JS library** (for live video playback).
- **All pages must work without JavaScript** for basic content. JS enhances (auto-refresh, live video) but pages should degrade gracefully.
- **No CDN dependencies.** All assets served locally. The system works without internet.

### 3.6 Testing Rules

#### Unit Testing (Mandatory)

- **Every code change must include unit tests.** No PR is merged without tests for the changed code.
- **Framework:** `pytest` for both server and camera apps.
- **Coverage tool:** `pytest-cov` (wraps coverage.py).
- **Minimum code coverage: 80%.** PRs that drop coverage below 80% are blocked.
- **Target code coverage: 90%+.** Aim higher for security-critical code (auth, pairing, TLS).
- **Test file naming:** `test_<module>.py` — mirrors the module it tests.
- **Test location:** `app/server/tests/` and `app/camera/tests/` (never inside the package itself).
- **Fixtures:** Shared fixtures go in `conftest.py` at the tests root.
- **Run tests before every commit:**

```bash
# Server tests
cd app/server
pytest --cov=monitor --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80

# Camera tests
cd app/camera
pytest --cov=camera_streamer --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80
```

#### What to Test

| Layer | What to test | How |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| Models | Dataclass creation, serialization, defaults | Direct instantiation |
| API endpoints | HTTP methods, status codes, response JSON, error cases | Flask test client |
| Auth | Login, logout, session, CSRF, rate limiting, role checks | Flask test client + mocks |
| Services | Business logic, edge cases, error handling | Unit test with mocked I/O |
| Config | Config loading, defaults, environment overrides | Monkeypatch env vars |
| Camera modules | Config parsing, stream lifecycle, discovery, pairing | Unit test with mocked hardware |

#### What NOT to Mock

- **Dataclasses and pure logic** — test these directly, no mocks needed.
- **Flask test client** — use `app.test_client()`, don't mock HTTP.

#### What to Mock

- **File system** (`/data/*` paths) — use `tmp_path` fixture.
- **External processes** (ffmpeg, libcamera) — mock `subprocess`.
- **System calls** (CPU temp, disk usage) — mock `os`/`shutil`/`psutil`.
- **Network** (Avahi/mDNS, RTSP) — mock socket/dbus calls.
- **Time** — mock `datetime.now()` for deterministic tests.

#### Coverage Reports

- **Terminal:** `--cov-report=term-missing` shows uncovered lines.
- **HTML:** `--cov-report=html` generates `htmlcov/` (gitignored).
- **CI:** Coverage is checked automatically. Build fails if below 80%.

#### Integration / Hardware Testing

- **Test on actual hardware** before merging significant changes. QEMU doesn't have camera hardware.
- **For app changes:** Use the rsync workflow on a dev image. Don't rebuild the full Yocto image for every code change.
- **For recipe changes:** Full bitbake build + parse check required.
- **API testing:** Document curl commands for each endpoint in the PR description.
- **Security testing:** Run through the threat model checklist (docs/architecture.md Section 3.1) for any change that touches auth, networking, or data storage.

## 4. File and Directory Rules

### 4.1 Where Things Go

| What | Where | Never |
|------|-------|-------|
| Application code | `app/server/` or `app/camera/` | In recipe `files/` dirs |
| Yocto recipes | `meta-home-monitor/recipes-*/` | In upstream layers |
| System config (systemd, nginx, nftables) | `app/<app>/config/` | Hardcoded in recipes |
| Build configuration | `config/` | In meta-home-monitor |
| Distro policy | `meta-home-monitor/conf/distro/` | In local.conf |
| Package lists | `meta-home-monitor/recipes-core/packagegroups/` | In image .bb files |
| Documentation | `docs/` | Scattered in code comments |
| Build scripts | `scripts/` | Inline in README |
| Partition layouts | `meta-home-monitor/wic/` | Hardcoded in recipes |

### 4.2 Naming Conventions

| Item | Convention | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Python files | `snake_case.py` | `camera_streamer.py` |
| Python classes | `PascalCase` | `RecorderService` |
| Python functions | `snake_case` | `get_camera_status()` |
| Python constants | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` | `MAX_CLIP_DURATION` |
| API endpoints | `/lowercase-kebab` | `/api/v1/cameras` |
| Yocto recipes | `<name>_<version>.bb` | `monitor-server_1.0.bb` |
| Yocto packagegroups | `packagegroup-<product>-<function>.bb` | `packagegroup-monitor-video.bb` |
| Config files | `kebab-case.conf` | `nginx-monitor.conf` |
| systemd units | `kebab-case.service` | `camera-streamer.service` |
| Git branches | `<type>/<kebab-case>` | `feature/camera-pairing` |
| Git tags | `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` | `v1.2.0` |

### 4.3 Files That Must Stay In Sync

When changing one, check if the others need updating:

| Change | Also update |
|--------|-------------|
| New API endpoint | `docs/requirements.md` (API section), `app/server/monitor/__init__.py` (blueprint registration) |
| New package in image | Appropriate packagegroup `.bb`, verify parse with `bitbake -p` |
| New Python dependency | `app/<app>/requirements.txt`, check `bitbake -s` for Yocto availability |
| New systemd service | Recipe `.bb` (SYSTEMD_SERVICE), `app/<app>/config/` |
| Distro feature change | `meta-home-monitor/conf/distro/home-monitor.conf`, may affect all images |
| Partition layout change | `meta-home-monitor/wic/*.wks`, `docs/architecture.md` (Section 5) |
| New image package | Packagegroup, NOT image .bb directly |
| Version bump | Distro config, `app/*/setup.py`, git tag, release notes |
| Security-relevant change | `docs/architecture.md` (threat model), `docs/requirements.md` (security section) |

---

## 5. Data & Storage Rules

### 5.1 Data Partition (`/data`)

- **Everything on `/data` must survive OTA updates.** The rootfs is replaced; `/data` persists.
- **File structure is part of the contract.** Don't reorganize without updating all consumers.
  ```
  /data/
    recordings/<cam-id>/YYYY-MM-DD/HH-MM-SS.mp4     ← clips
    recordings/<cam-id>/YYYY-MM-DD/HH-MM-SS.thumb.jpg ← thumbnails
    live/<cam-id>/stream.m3u8                          ← HLS playlist
    live/<cam-id>/segment_NNN.ts                       ← HLS segments
    config/cameras.json                                ← camera registry
    config/users.json                                  ← user accounts
    config/settings.json                               ← system settings
    certs/ca.crt, ca.key                               ← local CA
    certs/server.crt, server.key                       ← server TLS
    certs/cameras/<cam-id>.crt                         ← camera certs
    logs/audit.log                                     ← security events
  ```

### 5.2 JSON Data Files

- **Always write atomically:** Write to temp file, then `os.rename()` to final path. Never write directly (power loss = corruption).
- **Always read with a default fallback.** If the file is missing or corrupt, use defaults — don't crash.
- **Keep JSON schemas simple.** No nested arrays-of-objects deeper than 2 levels.
- **Camera IDs are immutable** (derived from hardware serial). Never allow rename of the ID itself.
- **User IDs are `usr-NNN`**, auto-incrementing. Never reuse deleted IDs.

### 5.3 Recording Files

- **File naming is the index.** We don't maintain a database of clips — the filesystem IS the database. Camera ID, date, and time are in the path.
- **3-minute segments, aligned to clock.** `14-00-00.mp4`, `14-03-00.mp4`, etc.
- **Thumbnails always alongside clips.** Same name with `.thumb.jpg` suffix.
- **ffmpeg must use `-movflags +faststart`** so clips are playable immediately without downloading the whole file.
- **Never delete a clip while it's being written.** Check the ffmpeg process before cleanup.

---

## 6. Deployment & Operations Rules

### 6.1 Image Flashing

- **Dev images for development only.** Never deploy dev images outside your test bench.
- **Prod images for real devices.** Always use prod for anything in a real home.
- **Label SD cards** with the image type and version (e.g., "server-prod v1.0.0").

### 6.2 OTA Updates

- **All OTA images must be signed** with Ed25519 (`scripts/sign-image.sh`).
- **Never push an unsigned image.** Devices will reject it.
- **Test OTA on a dev device first** before pushing to prod.
- **The signing private key is never committed to git.** It lives in `~/.monitor-keys/` on the build machine only.
- **Rollback:** If a new rootfs fails to boot 3 times, the device automatically rolls back. Never disable this.

### 6.3 Secrets Management

| Secret | Where it lives | Who can access |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| OTA signing private key | `~/.monitor-keys/ota-signing.key` on build machine | Build operator only |
| OTA signing public key | Embedded in rootfs (`/etc/monitor/ota-signing.pub`) | All devices (read-only) |
| CA private key | `/data/certs/ca.key` on server | Server process only (0600) |
| Server TLS key | `/data/certs/server.key` on server | nginx process (0640) |
| Camera client keys | `/data/certs/client.key` on each camera | Camera process only (0600) |
| User passwords | `/data/config/users.json` (bcrypt hashed) | Server process only (0640) |
| WiFi passwords | NetworkManager system-connections | Root only |
| GitHub SSH keys | `~/.ssh/` on build VM | Build operator only |

**Rules:**
- Never commit any of the above to git.
- Never log any of the above.
- Never transmit any private key over unencrypted channels.
- `.gitignore` must block `*.key`, `*.pem`, `users.json`.

---

## 7. Documentation Rules

### 7.1 What Must Be Documented

| Change type | Documentation required |
|---|---|
| New feature | Update `docs/requirements.md` (add user need or SW requirement) |
| New API endpoint | Update `docs/requirements.md` (SR-SRV-12 API section) |
| Architecture change | Update `docs/architecture.md` |
| Security change | Update threat model in `docs/architecture.md` Section 3 |
| New Yocto recipe/package | Update `README.md` (if it affects build) |
| Build process change | Update `README.md` and `scripts/build.sh` |
| New dev workflow | Update this file (`docs/development-guide.md`) |

### 7.2 Documentation Style

- **Markdown only.** No Word docs, no Google Docs, no wiki.
- **Keep docs in the repo** (in `docs/`). The docs ship with the code.
- **Update docs in the same PR as the code change.** Don't create "update docs" PRs after the fact.
- **Diagrams in ASCII art** (renders everywhere, no external tools).
- **Version numbers in docs:** Update when they change. Stale version numbers are misleading.

---

## 8. Open Source Rules

Since this is a public GitHub repository:

### 8.1 License

- **MIT License** for all custom code in this repository.
- **Every recipe must declare `LICENSE` and `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM`.**
- **Yocto generates SPDX license manifests** (enabled in distro config). These ship with the image and list every package and its license.
- **Before adding a new package:** Check its license is compatible. No GPL-3.0 in the base image if avoidable (it creates obligations for the binary distribution).

### 8.2 What Never Goes in the Repo

- Compiled binaries or images (use GitHub Releases)
- Private keys, certificates, or credentials
- Yocto build output (`build/`, `build-zero2w/`, `sstate-cache/`, `downloads/`)
- Upstream layers (`poky/`, `meta-raspberrypi/`, `meta-openembedded/`)
- IDE config except `.editorconfig` (no `.vscode/settings.json` with personal paths)
- Large media files (use Git LFS if absolutely necessary)

### 8.3 Issue Tracking

- **Use GitHub Issues** for bugs, features, and tasks.
- **Issue labels:** `bug`, `feature`, `recipe`, `security`, `docs`, `question`
- **Security vulnerabilities:** Open as private/confidential if GitHub supports it. Don't disclose details in public issues until fixed.

### 5.2 Server (RPi 4B)

#### SR-SRV-01: RTSP Stream Receiver

- Accept incoming RTSP streams from camera nodes
- One ffmpeg process per active camera
- Convert incoming RTSP to:
  - HLS segments for live browser playback (`.m3u8` + `.ts` segments, 2s duration)
  - MP4 clips for recording (3-minute segments)
- Handle camera disconnect/reconnect gracefully

#### SR-SRV-02: Recording Engine

- Segment recordings into 3-minute MP4 files
- File naming: `/data/recordings/<cam-id>/YYYY-MM-DD/HH-MM-SS.mp4`
- Generate thumbnail JPEG for each clip (extract frame at 1s mark)
- Recording modes (configurable per camera):
  - **Continuous**: always record
  - **Off**: stream only, no recording
  - (Phase 2: **Motion-triggered**: record on motion detection)

#### SR-SRV-03: Storage Management

- Monitor storage usage on data partition
- When usage exceeds 90% threshold: delete oldest clips across all cameras
- Never delete clips less than 24 hours old (even if over threshold — stop recording instead)
- Expose storage stats via API: total, used, free, oldest clip date, clip count per camera
- Configurable threshold percentage via settings

#### SR-SRV-04: Camera Discovery & Management

- Run avahi-daemon and browse for `_rtsp._tcp` services
- Display discovered cameras in dashboard as "pending" until user confirms
- For each confirmed camera, store in `/data/config/cameras.json`:
  - Camera ID, user-assigned name, location label, RTSP URL, recording mode

#### SR-SRV-06: Web Dashboard — Clip Playback

- Browse recordings by camera and date
- Timeline view showing clip availability (colored blocks on a 24h timeline)
- Play clips directly in browser (`<video>` tag, MP4 native playback)
- Navigation: previous/next clip, jump to time
- Thumbnail preview for each clip

#### SR-SRV-07: Web Dashboard — System Health

- Display for each camera: status (online/offline), uptime, current FPS, last seen timestamp
- Display for server: CPU temperature, CPU usage (%), RAM usage (%), disk usage (bar + numbers), uptime, network interfaces (IP, status)
- Auto-refresh every 10 seconds
- Warning indicators when thresholds exceeded (CPU temp > 70C, disk > 85%)

#### SR-SRV-08: Authentication & Authorization

- Login page required before accessing any route
- Two roles:
  - **Admin**: full access — configure cameras, manage users, change settings, delete clips, trigger OTA updates
  - **Viewer**: read-only — live view, clip playback, system health view
- First-boot setup wizard: create initial admin account, set timezone
- Password storage: bcrypt hashed, stored in `/data/config/users.json`
- Session-based auth with configurable timeout (default: 30 minutes)
- API endpoints: login, logout, create user (admin only), delete user (admin only), change password

#### SR-SRV-09: Settings

- Configurable via web dashboard (admin only):
  - Timezone (default: Europe/Dublin)
  - Per-camera: recording mode, resolution preference, name, location
  - Storage: retention threshold percentage, max retention days
  - Network: server hostname
- Settings persisted to `/data/config/settings.json`
- Settings survive OTA updates (on data partition)

#### SR-SRV-10: OTA Update Management

- Dual rootfs partitions (A/B layout) using swupdate
- Dashboard page (admin only): current server firmware version, available update (manual upload or URL)
- Push updates to connected cameras from server
- Update status tracking: idle, downloading, installing, rebooting, success, failed
- Automatic rollback on failed boot (3-attempt threshold)

#### SR-SRV-11: Nginx Configuration

- Self-signed TLS certificate (generated by local CA on first boot)
- `/live/<cam-id>/`: serve HLS segments for live view
- `/clips/<cam-id>/`: serve MP4 clips directly (nginx `mp4` module, byte-range support)
- `/snapshots/<cam-id>/`: serve thumbnail JPEGs
- `client_max_body_size`: 500MB (for OTA image uploads)
- Gzip compression for HTML/CSS/JS
- Rate limiting on `/api/v1/auth/login` (5 requests/minute per IP)

#### SR-SRV-12: REST API

## 5.3 Security Requirements

#### SR-SEC-01: TLS on All Connections

- HTTPS (TLS 1.3) for all browser-to-server traffic (port 443)
- RTSPS (RTSP over TLS) for all camera-to-server streams
- Self-signed CA generated on server first boot
- Server TLS certificate signed by local CA
- Camera client certificates signed by CA during pairing
- No plaintext HTTP or RTSP permitted in production

#### SR-SEC-02: Mutual TLS for Camera Authentication

- Each paired camera receives a unique client certificate
- Server verifies camera cert on every RTSP connection
- Unpaired/unknown cameras cannot stream to server
- Camera removal revokes the client certificate
- Certificate serial numbers tracked in cameras.json

#### SR-SEC-03: Encryption at Rest

- `/data` partition encrypted with LUKS2 (aes-xts-plain64)
- Server: passphrase set during first-boot setup wizard
- Camera: key derived from server-issued secret + hardware serial
- Protects: recordings, WiFi credentials, user database, certificates
- SD card theft yields no usable data without the passphrase

#### SR-SEC-04: Firewall (nftables)

- **Server:** Accept HTTPS (443) from LAN, RTSPS (8554) from paired camera IPs only, SSH (22) rate-limited from LAN. Drop everything else.
- **Camera:** Accept SSH from server IP only, OTA push from server IP only. Outbound: RTSPS to server only, DNS, DHCP, NTP, mDNS. Drop everything else.
- Camera IPs dynamically added to firewall set when paired
- All dropped packets logged

#### SR-SEC-05: No Default Credentials

- Production images built without `debug-tweaks` (no root password)
- Root SSH disabled in production; key-only SSH for a non-root service account
- First-boot wizard forces admin account creation before any access
- Development images retain debug-tweaks (separate build target)

#### SR-SEC-06: Secure Session Management

- Session cookies: `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`
- CSRF tokens on all state-changing requests (POST/PUT/DELETE)
- Session timeout: 30 minutes idle, 24 hours absolute
- Maximum 3 concurrent sessions per user
- Session invalidated on password change

#### SR-SEC-07: Rate Limiting

- Login endpoint: 5 attempts per minute per IP
- After 10 failed logins from same IP: block for 15 minutes
- API endpoints: 60 requests per minute per authenticated user
- OTA upload: 1 request per minute

#### SR-SEC-08: Audit Logging

- All security events logged to `/data/logs/audit.log`
- Events: login success/failure, session creation/expiry, camera pair/remove/offline, user CRUD, settings changes, clip deletion, OTA actions, firewall blocks
- Log format: JSON with timestamp, event type, user, source IP, detail
- Logs rotated at 50MB, retained 90 days
- Viewable in admin dashboard (Security Log page)
- Logs on encrypted partition (tamper-resistant when device is off)

#### SR-SEC-09: Signed OTA Updates

- OTA `.swu` images signed with Ed25519 keypair
- Build machine holds private signing key
- Devices hold public verification key (in rootfs, not /data)
- Update rejected if signature verification fails
- Prevents installation of malicious firmware

#### SR-SEC-10: Camera Pairing Protocol

- Camera discovered via mDNS appears as "pending" (untrusted)
- Admin explicitly confirms camera in dashboard
- Server generates unique client certificate + pairing token
- Token exchanged via camera's temporary setup AP or one-time HTTPS endpoint
- Only after pairing: camera can stream, receives firewall allowance
- Prevents rogue device from injecting fake video feeds

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-01: Reliability

- Server must operate 24/7 without manual intervention
- Services auto-restart on crash (systemd `Restart=always`, `WatchdogSec`)
- Recordings must not be corrupted if power is lost mid-write (MP4 mux finalized every segment)
- OTA updates must be atomic — never leave device in unbootable state

### NFR-02: Performance

- Live view latency < 3 seconds end-to-end
- Dashboard initial load < 2 seconds on WiFi
- API response time < 500ms for non-streaming endpoints
- Camera node CPU usage < 30% during streaming (hardware encode offloads to GPU)
- Server handles up to 8 simultaneous camera streams (Phase 2)

### NFR-03: Security

- TLS on all connections from Phase 1 (HTTPS + RTSPS with mTLS)
- No default passwords — first-boot wizard forces admin account creation
- All passwords bcrypt hashed (cost factor 12)
- Session tokens: cryptographically random, Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite cookies
- CSRF protection on all state-changing endpoints
- Encrypted data partition (LUKS2) — SD card theft yields nothing
- Firewall (nftables) — minimal open ports, camera IPs allowlisted
- Mutual TLS camera authentication — no rogue device injection
- Signed OTA images (Ed25519) — no malicious firmware
- Audit logging of all security events
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints (5 attempts per minute, block after 10 failures)
- See Section 5.3 (SR-SEC-01 through SR-SEC-10) for detailed security requirements
- See docs/architecture.md Section 3 for security architecture and threat model

### NFR-04: Storage Efficiency

- 1080p @ 25fps H.264 estimated: ~3-5 MB per minute, ~9-15 MB per 3-min clip
- 32GB SD card: ~1,500-3,000 clips = ~3-6 days continuous single camera
- 128GB SD card: ~12-24 days continuous single camera
- 1TB USB disk: ~100-200 days continuous single camera
- Loop recording prevents storage exhaustion

### NFR-05: Maintainability

- All custom software in `meta-home-monitor` layer (single repo)
- Configuration and data on separate partition (survives OTA)
- Structured logging via journald
- Version-tagged releases with pre-built images on GitHub

### NFR-06: Extensibility

The architecture must support future additions without redesign:
- Multiple cameras (discovery + per-camera config already in data model)
- Motion detection (recording mode enum already includes placeholder)
- Cloud relay (API already versioned, HTTPS planned)
- Mobile app (REST API already defined, no browser-specific dependencies)
- Smart home integration (ONVIF compatibility layer)
- Audio (transport and recording pipeline can add audio track)
- Clip protection/starring (add `protected` flag to clip metadata)

## 8. Open Questions / Future Decisions

| # | Question | When to decide |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 1 | Exact swupdate partition sizes — depends on rootfs size after all packages | During OTA implementation |
| 2 | Cloud relay architecture — small VPS with WireGuard tunnel vs. hosted signaling | Phase 2 planning |
| 3 | Mobile app framework — React Native, Flutter, or native | Phase 2 planning |
| 4 | Motion detection library — OpenCV on-device vs. server-side analysis | Phase 2 planning |
| 5 | ONVIF compliance level for smart home integration | Phase 3 planning |
| 6 | Audio codec and sync strategy when mic-equipped cameras are added | Phase 2 planning |
| 7 | Backup strategy for `/data` partition (clips, config) | Phase 1 refinement |
